# Overview

In the construction of this program I was building on my knowledge of Javascript and Web Development by learning REACT. I decided to continue building on a previous project to work with conversions and additions when it comes to converting from HTML/CSS/JS to JSX/JS/CSS.

This program is a Web App that will take users input from a shopping cart (stainless steel bottles) and allow them to put their own customizations on them and checkout while being able to see the additional costs for adding said customizations.

# Web Pages

On this web app there is only one web page that is being used consistently, there are multiple ALERTS that are used and Dialogue pop up boxes to help the user see what items they currently have chosen and the customizations they have made. Dynamic responses include: 
- saving previous library/template choices
- taking text input from the user
- overlaying the text on a user selected png
- overlaying a template img on a user selected png
- updating prices and storing final customization decisions

* Fixing every template to be fully transparent to give more realistic previewing
* Making all templates default to a silver lining to give more realistic previewing
